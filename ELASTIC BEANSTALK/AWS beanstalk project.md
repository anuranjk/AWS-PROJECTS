\## ðŸŽ¯ Goal



\- the goal was to successfully deploy and test a webapp in elastic beanstalk. 







\## âš™ Steps Taken



1\. Created new environment and application in beanstalk(learned about cloud formation and stacks)



2\. Condigured different settings in the creation of new environment(networking, database, monitoring..) 



3\. Deployed the source code as a zip file(there was some errors in it) 



4\. verified connectivity(via port 80)  







\## âœ… Outcome / Learnings



\- Cloud Formation and stacks 



\- There is a certain format and order for the zip file inorder to beanstalk detect the application 



\- main issue was with the code format i fixed it then reuploaded .



\- Then i couldn't access the application i checked many setting but the problem was with the url i pasted in the browser, it accessed it through https instead of http.
